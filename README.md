### 👋 ABOUT ME

My name is Jean. I'm starter front end developer

Passionate about games, programming, and technology. I am seeking opportunities to learn and grow as a developer. I enjoy solving problems and am constantly looking for new challenges. I’m currently learning about Angular, React and Java

In addition to my interest in programming, I had the opportunity to participate in training on agile methodologies, with a focus on Scrum, and after the training, I was able to obtain the PSM I certification from Scrum.org.

On a personal level, I am passionate about cultural expressions, especially music and dance. Whenever there's an opportunity, I like to attend dances and Forró gatherings, as well as go out for a bike ride.
